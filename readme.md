## Unity tutorial project

This project was made as an intro to Unity 2D for my classmates at Galvanize, but anyone is welcome to use it as a learning tool or as a base for their own project! I'm not an expert at Unity, just an enthusiastic hobbyist, so if you spot anything I could improve on, pull requests are welcome :)

Instructions:
1. Fork/clone this repo
2. Run Unity, select "open" from the Projects window, or go to file > Open Project...
3. Select the unity-tutorial folder

All assets in this project are free for personal use and either made by me or downloaded from http://opengameart.org
